# Realtime-fault-detection-edgeML
Real-time multi-label fault detection system using XGBoost on Raspberry Pi. Processes multi-sensor data to identify gas leaks, temperature overshoot, and tank leaks simultaneously. Enables efficient, low-latency fault monitoring for industrial IoT and edge computing applications.

# About setting up RPi for the deployment
